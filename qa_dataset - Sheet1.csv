What are capital gains?,Profits and gains arising from transfer of ownership of capital assets shall be capital gains
When shall profits and gains be treated as capital gains?,When they arise from transfer of ownership of capital assets.

Which notional gains following the Fair Market Value Method are not treated as capital gains?,International Accounting Standards (IAS) or International Reporting Standards (IFRS).
 Under what method are notional gains or profits evaluated according to IAS or IFRS?,The Fair Market Value Method.
Explain what is meant by Capital Gains according to this section.,"According to this section, Capital Gains refer to the profits or gains that come from the transfer of ownership of a capital asset — for example, when someone sells property, shares, or other assets and earns a profit from it. However, if the gain is only notional that means, only calculated on paper using accounting standards like IAS or IFRS based on Fair Market Value, and the asset has not been actually transferred, then such gain shall not be treated as capital gains for tax purposes."
Why are notional gains not considered as capital gains under this section?,"Notional gains are not considered as capital gains because they do not result from an actual transfer of ownership of an asset. According to the section, only real profits or gains arising from the transfer of capital assets are taxable as capital gains. Gains calculated merely for accounting purposes under IAS or IFRS using the Fair Market Value Method are not treated as real transactions, so they are excluded."
What is the main condition for a profit to be treated as capital gains?,"The main condition is that the profit must arise from the transfer of ownership of a capital asset. Without an actual transfer, the gain is not recognized as capital gains under the law."
How do International Accounting Standards (IAS) or IFRS relate to capital gains in this section?,The section mentions IAS and IFRS to clarify that any gain calculated under these accounting standards — by using the Fair Market Value Method — is not considered a real or taxable capital gain unless the asset has actually been transferred.
What is the difference between actual capital gain and notional capital gain?,"An actual capital gain arises when a capital asset is genuinely sold or transferred, leading to real profit.A notional capital gain, on the other hand, is an estimated increase in value shown in financial statements based on market valuation standards like IAS or IFRS — it doesn’t involve any real transfer or cash gain."
What is the purpose of including the Fair Market Value Method in this section?,The Fair Market Value Method is mentioned to make it clear that revaluation or paper-based profit from asset valuation under accounting standards should not be treated as taxable capital gains. It ensures that only actual transfers leading to real gains are taxed.
What is capital gain according to the Computation of Capital Gains?,The capital gains of a person shall be the difference between the sale or transfer price of an asset in the open market and the cost of acquisition of that asset.
How is the capital gain of a person calculated?,By subtracting the cost of acquisition of the asset from the open market sale or transfer price of that asset.
What does “open market sale or transfer price” mean?,"It means the higher of “A” and “B”, where A = amount received or accrued from transfer of capital assets, and B = fair market value of the capital asset on the date of transfer."
What does “A” represent in the Computation of Capital Gains?,“A” represents the amount received or accrued from the transfer of capital assets.
What does “B” represent in the computation of Capital Gains?,“B” represents the fair market value of the capital asset on the date of transfer.
What are included in the cost of acquisition of an asset?,"(1) Expenses solely related to the transfer of ownership, (2) purchase price of the asset, and (3) cost of development of such asset other than the cost allowed under section 38, 42, 49, 50 or 64."
What kind of expenses are considered related to the transfer of ownership?,Any such expenses which are solely related to the transfer of ownership of the said asset.
"What happens when the asset is acquired by gift, bequest, or will?",The fair market value on the date of ownership of the asset by the transferee shall be deemed to be the cost of acquisition.
In which cases shall the fair market value on the date of ownership be deemed to be the cost of acquisition?,"When the asset is acquired under gift, bequest, will, succession, inheritance, devolution, revocable or irrevocable trust, company liquidation, or partition of firm, association, or Hindu undivided family."
What is considered as the cost of development of an asset?,"The cost of development of such asset, if any, other than the cost allowed under section 38, 42, 49, 50, or 64."
Explain how capital gains are computed according to the Computation of Capital Gains,"According tothe Computation of Capital Gains, capital gains are computed as the difference between the open market sale or transfer price of a capital asset and its cost of acquisition. The open market price is determined as the higher of the actual amount received or accrued from the transfer and the fair market value of the asset on the date of transfer. The cost of acquisition includes the purchase price, development cost, and any expenses directly related to transferring ownership."
What factors are considered in determining the open market sale or transfer price of a capital asset?,"The open market sale or transfer price is determined by comparing two values — (A) the amount received or accrued from the transfer of the capital asset, and (B) the fair market value of that asset on the date of transfer. Whichever is higher between A and B is considered the open market sale price for computing capital gains."
Describe what is included in the cost of acquisition of an asset under the Computation of Capital Gains,"The cost of acquisition includes three main components: any expenses solely related to the transfer of ownership of the asset; the purchase price of the asset; and the cost of developing the asset, except for those already. This comprehensive calculation ensures that both direct and developmental expenses are reflected in the acquisition value allowed under sections 38, 42, 49, 50, or 64."
Explain how the cost of acquisition is determined when an asset is received as a gift or through inheritance.,"When an asset is acquired as a gift, bequest, inheritance, or through trust or company liquidation, the recipient does not bear an actual purchase cost. In such cases, the law considers the fair market value of the asset on the date the transferee becomes the owner as its cost of acquisition. This ensures fair taxation on subsequent transfer or sale of the asset."
Why does the law consider the higher value between amount received and fair market value while computing capital gains?,"The law chooses the higher value between the actual amount received and the fair market value to prevent tax evasion. If only the declared sale price were used, taxpayers could undervalue assets to reduce capital gains tax. By using the higher of the two values, the law ensures fair and accurate taxation based on the asset’s real economic worth."

What if fair market value is 25% higher than declared acquisition value?,"The Deputy Commissioner of Taxes may offer to buy the asset at the declared acquisition value, following the manner prescribed by the Board."
When is capital gain exempt from tax?,"A capital gain is exempt from tax when all capital assets of a partnership firm are transferred to a new company registered under the Companies Act, 1994, and the entire consideration from the transfer is invested in the equity of that new company."
Explain the condition under which capital gains from a partnership firm’s asset transfer become tax-exempt.,"Capital gains from a partnership firm’s asset transfer are exempt from tax if all capital assets are transferred to a new company registered under the Companies Act, 1994, and the entire transfer consideration is reinvested in the equity shares of that new company.
